```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

cereals_data <- read_csv(here::here('Week 4', 'cereal.csv'))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cereal, echo=FALSE}
cereals_long <- cereals_data
  pivot_longer(c('protein', 'fat', 'fiber'))
    names_to = 'Nutrients',
    values_to = 'Amount') %>% 
  select(name, Nutrients, Amount)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

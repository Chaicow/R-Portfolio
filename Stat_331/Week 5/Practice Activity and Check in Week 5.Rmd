```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

colleges_clean <- read_csv(here::here('Week 5', 'colleges_clean.csv'))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r college, echo=FALSE}
colleges_clean <- colleges_clean %>% 
  mutate(
    CONTROL = factor(REGION),
    Type = fct_recode(REGION,
                      `0` = "Military", 
                      `2` = "New England"
                      `1` = "East"
                      `3` = "Midwest"
                )
  
  )

summary(colleges_clean$REGION)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
